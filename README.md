------------------
To develop a solution for AI-generated videos based on your project requirements, here's an outline of the Python code and approach you might use to integrate AI tools into your video creation process. Although Python itself isn't directly used for animation creation, you can combine Python for automating tasks, interfacing with APIs of AI video creation tools, and video editing.

Given the project scope, AI-generated video tools like Synthesia, Colossyan, or InVideo are great options for generating the videos. Python can help with data preprocessing, organizing files, and automating the communication with these platforms.

Hereâ€™s how you can set up and automate the process:
1. Setting Up the Python Script:

This script will serve as an example to automate interactions with video creation APIs (like Synthesia, Colossyan, etc.) and edit the final video.

import requests
import json
import time
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, concatenate_videoclips

# Define your video creation tool API details (replace with actual API keys and endpoints)
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
VIDEO_CREATION_API_URL = 'https://api.synthesia.io/create_video'
VIDEO_SCRIPT_PATH = 'path_to_script.txt'  # Path to your narration script

# Function to create a video using AI tools (e.g., Synthesia)
def create_ai_video(scene_script, voiceover_file, scene_id):
    # Request payload for the API (this will depend on the specific API documentation)
    data = {
        "scene": scene_id,
        "script": scene_script,
        "voiceover": voiceover_file,  # This could be a pre-recorded narration file
        "background_music": "background_music.mp3",  # Optional background music
        "api_key": API_KEY
    }
    
    # Send request to AI video creation tool
    response = requests.post(VIDEO_CREATION_API_URL, json=data)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        video_url = response.json().get('video_url')
        return video_url
    else:
        print(f"Error creating video: {response.text}")
        return None

# Function to download the generated video
def download_video(video_url, output_path):
    video_response = requests.get(video_url)
    
    if video_response.status_code == 200:
        with open(output_path, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(video_response.content)
        print(f"Video saved at {output_path}")
    else:
        print(f"Error downloading video: {video_response.text}")

# Function to add narration and background music to a video using moviepy
def add_narration_to_video(video_path, narration_path, background_music_path):
    video = VideoFileClip(video_path)
    narration = AudioFileClip(narration_path)
    background_music = AudioFileClip(background_music_path)
    
    # Adjust audio to fit the video length (for example, we will set the background music volume and duration)
    final_audio = CompositeAudioClip([background_music.volumex(0.2), narration])
    video = video.set_audio(final_audio)

    # Export the final video
    final_video_path = video_path.replace('.mp4', '_final.mp4')
    video.write_videofile(final_video_path, codec='libx264', audio_codec='aac')
    print(f"Final video with narration saved at {final_video_path}")

# Main function to create and download videos for each scene
def create_project_videos():
    # Loop through all scenes (this would be based on your storyboard)
    for scene_id in range(1, 9):
        # Read the script for this scene (replace this with actual script generation logic)
        with open(VIDEO_SCRIPT_PATH, 'r') as f:
            scene_script = f.read().strip()

        # Define the voiceover file (this can be pre-recorded or generated by text-to-speech)
        voiceover_file = f"voiceover_scene_{scene_id}.mp3"

        # Step 1: Create video for this scene
        print(f"Creating video for Scene {scene_id}...")
        video_url = create_ai_video(scene_script, voiceover_file, scene_id)
        
        if video_url:
            video_output_path = f"scene_{scene_id}.mp4"
            # Step 2: Download the video
            download_video(video_url, video_output_path)

            # Step 3: Add narration and background music to the video
            add_narration_to_video(video_output_path, voiceover_file, "background_music.mp3")
            
            time.sleep(5)  # Introducing a small delay to avoid spamming the API

# Start the video creation process
create_project_videos()

Key Steps in the Code:

    create_ai_video: This function sends a request to the video creation API (such as Synthesia or Colossyan) with a given script, voiceover, and optional background music. It will return the URL of the generated video.

    download_video: Once the video is generated, this function downloads it using the URL returned by the AI tool.

    add_narration_to_video: After the video is generated, this function uses moviepy (a Python library for video editing) to synchronize the voiceover and background music with the video, and then exports the final product.

    create_project_videos: This main function loops through all scenes, creates videos, adds narrations, and downloads them. It processes each scene based on the storyboard you provide.

Libraries Used:

    requests: Used for interacting with the AI video generation APIs.
    moviepy: For editing and finalizing videos (adding narration, background music, etc.).
    time: Introduces delays between requests to avoid hitting API rate limits.

Integrating Voiceover and Music:

    Voiceover: You can use pre-recorded voiceover files or use AI text-to-speech tools like Google Text-to-Speech or Amazon Polly to generate voiceovers for each scene.
    Background Music: You can add background music to the video through the moviepy library.

Deployment:

    Prepare your script: Have a clean version of your script ready for each video scene.
    Pre-record narration: You can record the voiceover using any audio recording tool and store it as .mp3 files.
    Upload background music: Prepare background tracks that you wish to use in the videos.
    Run the script: Execute the Python script to automate the entire video creation process.

Final Output:

After running the script, you will receive:

    AI-generated videos with proper narration.
    Background music synchronized.
    Final video files in MP4 format.

Additional Notes:

    Customization: You can adjust the video style, voice type, and animation in your AI video generation tool (e.g., Synthesia or Colossyan) to better match your desired aesthetic.
    Error Handling: You can add more robust error handling in case of API issues or timeouts, ensuring smooth execution.

This Python solution allows you to efficiently create, download, and enhance AI-generated videos based on your project storyboard.
